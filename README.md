# Sudoku Solver using Backtracking

This project is a **Sudoku Solver** implemented in Python using the **backtracking algorithm**.  
It takes a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle with empty cells (represented by `0`) and fills in the grid while following Sudoku rules:

- Each row must contain digits **1â€“9** without repetition.  
- Each column must contain digits **1â€“9** without repetition.  
- Each 3x3 subgrid must also contain digits **1â€“9** without repetition.  

If the puzzle cannot be solved, the program returns **"No solution exists"**.
